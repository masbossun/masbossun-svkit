Implementing winsen portofolio website design into real functional website. His passion for design is immense, he have been designing a lot of projects, from web design to product design.

Built with [React.JS](https://www.reactjs.org) which is currently a popular javascript framework and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) a complete css framework to boost the development process. This projcet took around 2 weeks to complete. There are some parts that are quite tricky, such as responsiveness, fullscreen modals, and progressive loading images, but am so happy with the results.

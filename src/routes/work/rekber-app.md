This is my new project about transaction app called Rekber (Rekening Bersama). Inspired by my friend's ideas about his experiences on selling and buying game items online. It has features like chat, forum, and transaction built-in.

Designed using [Figma](https://www.figma.com), cool illustrations by [Open Peeps](https://www.openpeeps.com/) and awesome images by [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/). Using minimal colours, just play with colour shades. The icons are from [Unicons](https://iconscout.com/unicons), a little bit of edit for tab icons to distinguish some state.
